Program 5, myString

Summary: This program is redefining the string class as if it never existed using cstring methods.
         Many of the methods were collaborated on but most were done on my own. There are relational
         and assignment operators (all practical things that a programmer would want to do with strings).

File included:
    README.txt - this file
    main.test.cpp - the test function that was originally the v4 but was updated and name changed
                    used to assert and fully test each method
    myString.cpp - this is where the myString methods were written and documented. This is the private
                   code that would be sold to a company to use these methods, which can access private data
                   to manipulate, create, destroy methods to the users liking.
    myString.h - this is where the methods are defined and where the class pieces are set to private or public.
                 These are the proprietary secrets we covet as we look to publish our myString exe.

Status: working great.
